To change the song that is used for a certain weather type, run the application and open the flask site.  Drag your audio file onto the button with the name of the weather type you're targeting. 

To add additional weather types, find the name on https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/#codes and add it to the conditions list in index.html, then rerun the application and drag the mp3 onto the new button on the site.
